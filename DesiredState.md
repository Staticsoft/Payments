# Payments - Desired State

## Overview
A Stripe payment integration library that provides a simplified interface for managing subscriptions and customers. The library focuses on subscription lifecycle management and customer operations, with support for testing various subscription statuses.

## Aggregators

### Billing
Manages payment-related operations including subscriptions and customers.

**Composed Interfaces**:
- `Subscriptions` - Manages subscription lifecycle and status
- `Customers` - Manages customer records

## Interfaces

### Subscriptions
Manages subscription lifecycle including creation and cancellation.

**Methods**:
```csharp
public interface Subscriptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Lists all subscriptions for a specific customer.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="customerId">The unique identifier of the customer.</param>
    /// <returns>A collection of subscriptions belonging to the customer.</returns>
    Task<IReadOnlyCollection<Subscription>> List(string customerId);
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Retrieves a specific subscription by its identifier.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="subscriptionId">The unique identifier of the subscription.</param>
    /// <returns>The subscription with the specified identifier.</returns>
    /// <exception cref="Subscriptions.NotFoundException">Thrown when the subscription does not exist.</exception>
    Task<Subscription> Get(string subscriptionId);
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Creates a new subscription for a customer.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="newSubscription">The subscription details.</param>
    /// <returns>The created subscription.</returns>
    Task<Subscription> Create(NewSubscription newSubscription);
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Cancels an active subscription.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="subscriptionId">The unique identifier of the subscription to cancel.</param>
    /// <returns>The canceled subscription.</returns>
    /// <exception cref="Subscriptions.NotFoundException">Thrown when the subscription does not exist.</exception>
    Task<Subscription> Cancel(string subscriptionId);
}
```

**Exceptions**:

## Test Scenarios

Test scenarios are ordered by increasing complexity, following the test ordering strategy.

### Level 1: Exception Tests (No State Changes)

#### Scenario: Get non-existing subscription throws NotFoundException
**Given** the system is empty  
**When** I try to get a subscription with ID "non-existing-id"  
**Then** a `Subscriptions.NotFoundException` is thrown

#### Scenario: Get non-existing customer throws NotFoundException
**Given** the system is empty  
**When** I try to get a customer with ID "non-existing-id"  
**Then** a `Customers.NotFoundException` is thrown

#### Scenario: Cancel non-existing subscription throws NotFoundException
**Given** the system is empty  
**When** I try to cancel a subscription with ID "non-existing-id"  
**Then** a `Subscriptions.NotFoundException` is thrown

#### Scenario: Delete non-existing customer throws NotFoundException
**Given** the system is empty  
**When** I try to delete a customer with ID "non-existing-id"  
**Then** a `Customers.NotFoundException` is thrown

### Level 2: Read-Only Operations on Empty System

#### Scenario: List customers returns empty collection when no customers exist

### Level 3: Single Create + Verify

#### Scenario: Create customer and verify it exists
